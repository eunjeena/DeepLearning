This project follows instructions based on Coursera- 'Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning'
# Image processing
## Convolution
- narrows down the content of the image to focus on specific, distinct, details.
- good for computer vision, because information going to the dense layers is more focused, and possible more accurate.
- reduces the size of the feature maps by a bit dut to padding.

## Pooling
- reduces the information in an image whilte maintaining features.
- halves the dimensions.


### Takeaways
    1. Adding more neurons (than 128), more calculation, slow learning,
but more accurate based on training data.

    2. Input layer should have same shape of the data. 28*28 input would be infeasible, so better to 'flatten' into 28*28=784*1 by using Flatten().

    3. Increasing epochs has decreasing loss, but it could overfit the data.
    
    4. Normalizing the input data is important
